### SlicedWalkthroughs
I have always had a passion for Technology, starting from when I had the first iPad or my first Macbook. When I got my Macbook it seemed many of my friends did not know how to use them, So I started a YouTube Channel at 13yrs old. 

It started as iPad tutorials for 'Slice It' on particularly hard levels. The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5dW-kQ5n84) was me pointing a camera at an iPad and a song I made myself on Garageband. After 3 more of these videos I moved on to Mac tutorials.

Specificallky my most popular videos at the time were for GeekTools. This was a cool Mac app that allowed you to customise your desktop with all sorts of info.

From there it was various tutorials that I thought there was a need for. My first popular video was ["How to Dual Monitors on a Macbook Pro"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvtYatV7PKk) with over 40k views. Something I considered amazing at as a 13yr old.

My last video was 5yrs ago and turned out to be the most popular, ["How to Map Keys on a Mac"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky6zzzAkqHc)

Interestingly, depsite the channel existing for 10yrs out most popular year was 2020 as I imagine several people needed to use their Mac's to work from home.
