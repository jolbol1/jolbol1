## Hello Guys! 👋
---
I am a self-taught software engineer. 

### 💻 Current Projects
* Codecademy Full-Stack Course
* Exploring possible career paths within Software Engineering

### 👨 Bio
* 🏢 Based in London UK.
* ⚙️ I am self-taught in Java, Pyhton, JavaScript, CSS and HTML
* 🌱 Learning all about Open Source
* 💬 Very passionate about online data control/privacy.
* ✨ Studied Accounting and Finance at Durham University
* 🏢 Began Coding for Minecraft Plugins in Java when I was 12.

### 🌎 Largest Project
RandomCoordinates: A Minecraft plugin. This was one of my first serious coding projects and was all self-taught. There is 2 repos for this on my page, one was the first attempt and then a complete re-write once I became more advanced at Java.

While the project is no longer maintained it has amassed over 100,000 downloads on various sites (e.g [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/randomcoords-rtp-advanced-random-teleporter.1680/))

### 🔒 Securtiy / Privacy
Security and Privacy has become a particularly hot topic within technology within the last few years. I started to take an interest when my accounts were involved in several data breaches. Since then I have ensured I use a different password for all services, a different email (using a catch-all at my custom domain) and enabling two factor for my most important services.

Furthermore, I try to ensure I am browsing the interent as safely as possible. For example, using a Pi-Hole to block all tracking requestst and adverts on my entire home network. Using Linux and Firefox (with Modifications) for my web browsing and using a VPN. Its not that I have something to hide, I just prefer to be in control of how and what data is collected.

I also self-host:
* A Media Server
* My backups for phone, computer and general files
* Speedtest
* Meta-Search Engine (SearX)
* VS Code
* And anything else I can!

### 🎞️ YouTube
#### SlicedWalkthroughs
I have always had a passion for Technology, starting from when I had the first iPad or my first Macbook. When I got my Macbook it seemed many of my friends did not know how to use them, So I started a YouTube Channel at 13yrs old. 

It started as iPad tutorials for 'Slice It' on particularly hard levels. The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5dW-kQ5n84) was me pointing a camera at an iPad and a song I made myself on Garageband. After 3 more of these videos I moved on to Mac tutorials.

Specifically my most popular videos at the time were for GeekTools. This was a cool Mac app that allowed you to customise your desktop with all sorts of info.

From there it was various tutorials that I thought there was a need for. My first popular video was ["How to Dual Monitors on a Macbook Pro"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvtYatV7PKk) with over 40k views. Something I considered amazing at as a 13yr old.

My last video was 5yrs ago and turned out to be the most popular, ["How to Map Keys on a Mac"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky6zzzAkqHc)

Interestingly, depsite the channel existing for 10yrs out most popular year was 2020 as I imagine several people needed to use their Mac's to work from home.

#### FuzedDesigns
I also once had a YouTube channel dedicated to photoshop speed arts and YouTube channel design (backgrounds, logos, etc). Unfortunatley the channel is no longer up.

#### Misc Failed and Removed Channel (I tried a lot)
* SlicedDesigns
* CraziiPlays
* ImBaffled
* JolbolCrafts
* Many many more embarassing names
